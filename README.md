# Semipublic's Financial Document Repository

This is a collection of every publicly available financial document subitted by public media entities to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. These documents feed the database at data.semipublic.co as well as the Substack at semipublic.co.

Within each fiscal year, you'll find a CSV containing an index of every CPB grantee for that year as well as what kinds of documents are associated with that grantee.

## Types of documents

- **Annual Financial Reports**: These are required for all potential CPB grantees with an annual revenue of over $300,000 and contain detailed breakdowns of revenue and expenditures by type and source. AFRs vary slightly depending on whether the potential grantee is a radio or a television station.
- **Financial Summary Reports**: These are required for all potential CPB grantees with an annual revenue of less than $300,000 and contain slightly less detailed breakdowns of revenue and expendutures by type and source. FSRs for radio and television stations are identical, though television stations rarely make less than $300,000 in yearly revenue.
- **Audited Financial Statements**: These are supplementary to both AFRs and FSRs and are completed by a certified accountant. The structure of AFSes can vary from accountant-to-accountant and contain highly detailed breakdowns of assets, liabilties, cash on hand, expenses, and revenue.
